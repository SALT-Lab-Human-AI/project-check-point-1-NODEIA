## Problem & Importance

American education is in trouble. When [less than half of kids can read at grade level,](https://caaspp-elpac.ets.org/caaspp/DashViewReportSB?ps=true&lstTestYear=2024&lstTestType=B&lstGroup=1&lstSubGroup=1&lstSchoolType=A&lstGrade=13&lstCounty=00&lstDistrict=00000&lstSchool=0000000) and even fewer can handle basic math, we have a serious problem. It's not just about test scores either. As a nation, there are over 400,000 teaching positions [either unfulfilled or employing teachers without full certifications.](https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/product/state-teacher-shortages-vacancy-resource-tool-2024)

Although places like [Two By Two Learning Center](https://www.twobytwolearningcenters.com) are doing incredible work to support kids after school, [over 60%](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/spp/results.asp) of public schools nationally offer academically focused after-school programming. Kids are falling further behind, tutors are burning out, and everyone is frustrated. We desperately need tools that can exemplify the impact of the educators and help kids learn.

## Initial Risks & Mitigation

Safety: We as a team have to be very careful with how we design our AI tutor, especially because our app will be utilized by children. Our audience is very susceptible to misinformation or distractions. Nothing the AI outputs should be unrelated to the specific academic question at hand. 

Privacy: Any conversations with the AI tutor will need to be held in a secure database or not stored at all so that conversations from the underage users are not broadcasted to the public. 

Bias: Our app needs to remain unbiased in how it answers questions, and feel like a real tutor encouraging the student as they work. We do not want the AI tutor to give any sort of biased result to students, nor for the tutor to be biased towards one student over another (e.g. the model giving more positive feedback to students who respond positively to said feedback).

Reliability: The AI tutor model we create needs to be reliable. It cannot afford to get answers or hints to students incorrect or be vague in its wording. The AI has to be relied upon to give factual information every single time it is prompted.
