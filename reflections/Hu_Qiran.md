### Summary

The paper addresses the critical challenge of employees struggling to meet future industry needs in the rapid digital transformation, where traditional online programs often fail to provide personalized learning for diverse learners with varying backgrounds and expertise levels. The authors propose RAG PRISM, which is an adaptive tutoring framework that combines sentiment analysis from VR based Digital Twin learning environments with Retrieval Augmented Generation to deliver personalized instruction based on both emotional and cognitive states. The framework uses LlamaIndex for document retrieval and various GPT models for response generation. With evaluation metrics focusing on faithfulness and relevancy, this framework ensures that responses are consistent with retrieved content and address the actual query. Their evaluation demonstrates that GPT 4 achieved perfect faithfulness scores of 1.0 and high relevancy of 0.87. However, with their retrieval system, it achieves a perfect hit rate and Mean Reciprocal Rank scores of 1.0, which indicates the framework's capability to deliver accurate response.

### Three Key Insights

First, the integration of sentiment analysis with RAG represents a significant advancement in adaptive learning systems as the framework monitors both what students know and how they feel during the learning process. Hence, the system can adjust content delivery based on emotional indicators like frustration or engagement. Compared to traditional AI systems that only focus on providing answers, this new approach fosters a greater sense of connection for students throughout their learning process.

Second, the evaluation method in this paper uses both synthetic and manual queries to provide a robust framework for testing retrieval systems. They utilize synthetic QA pairs generated from document chunks to test whether the system can locate the exact source material used to create answers. They also use manual queries to test real world robustness against ambiguous or poorly formed questions. This approach makes sure that the system works both in ideal conditions and with the messier queries that actual students generate.

Third, as the response length inversely correlates with quality, it challenges common assumptions about AI tutoring. GPT 4 Turbo produced the longest responses with a lower relevancy of 0.60 compared to GPT 4's more concise and highly relevant responses of 0.87. Thus, this suggests that verbosity can actually harm educational effectiveness by introducing drift from the core query intent.

### Two Limitations and Risks

The most significant limitation is that it lacks real world validation with actual students. The system was evaluated entirely on synthetic queries and curated manual questions with no measurement of actual learning outcomes, knowledge retention, or student performance improvements. Without evidence from real educational settings, the framework's effectiveness remains theoretical.

Another critical risk involves the system's dependency on the quality of its document corpus. The framework's high faithfulness scores demonstrate that it will accurately reproduce whatever is in its knowledge base, which includes any errors, biases, or outdated information. In educational contexts, this could lead to the confident delivery of incorrect information, which becomes particularly problematic in rapidly evolving fields where best practices change frequently.

### One Concrete Application for Our Project

For our AI tutoring tool project using Neo4j knowledge graphs, we aim to implement RAG PRISM's dual evaluation strategy to generate synthetic QA pairs by traversing knowledge relationships in our graph. For example, if “fractions” requires understanding “division”, then the system will automatically generate prerequisite checking questions. This approach would validate both the correctness of our knowledge graph relationships and the system's ability to handle the imperfect and grade appropriate queries that K-12 students actually produce. Hence, this approach ensures that our rewards systems are triggered by genuine understanding rather than pattern matching.
